# Photos

The original source photos for the application will not be stored within
the Meteor application and will not be tracked in Git since they would take
up too much space.

The photos are tracked here in folders with these naming conventions:

## source-v\#\#
These are the original images as they come from San Diego. As they update
images I'll keep them in successive version folders.

## processed-v\#\#
Once we shrink the images and make different versions we'll move them here.
These version numbers should match up with the source.
